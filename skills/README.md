# Skills library (placeholder)

Many agent frameworks maintain a "skills" library:

- reusable tool compositions
- high-level workflows
- domain-specific macros

In this scaffold, skills can be implemented as:
- Python functions that call tools in a fixed sequence, or
- prompt templates + tool policies.

Add skills here as your project grows.
